## Import

A Record can be imported using its `id`. Use the API to get all records of
a zone and then copy the id. 

```
curl "https://dns.hetzner.com/api/v1/records" \
     -H "Auth-API-Token: $HETZNER_DNS_API_TOKEN" | jq .

{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "3d60921a49eb384b6335766a",
      "type": "TXT",
      "name": "google._domainkey",
      "value": "\"anything:with:param\"",
      "zone_id": "rMu2waTJPbHr4",
      "created": "2020-08-18 19:11:02.237 +0000 UTC",
      "modified": "2020-08-28 19:51:41.275 +0000 UTC"
    },
    {
      "id": "ed2416cb6bc8a8055b22222",
      "type": "A",
      "name": "www",
      "value": "1.1.1.1",
      "zone_id": "rMu2waTJPbHr4",
      "created": "2020-08-27 20:55:38.745 +0000 UTC",
      "modified": "2020-08-27 20:55:38.745 +0000 UTC"
    }
  ]
}
```

The command used above was copied from Hetzer DNS API docs. `jq` is
used for formatting and is not required. Use the `id` to import a
record. 

```
terraform import hetznerdns_record.dkim_1 ed2416cb6bc8a8055b22222
```
